# Final Project: Computing Fundamentals
## NeuralGen-HH for the Firefighter Problem

> Based on: https://github.com/jcobayliss/FFPHHS

Steps to setup the environment:
- Activate conda: `source ~/miniforge3/bin/activate`
- Create new virtual environment and activate it: `conda activate venv`
- Install dependencies specified in `requirements.txt` file.

Run the program:
1. User can either choose between the following two models to predict the next heuristic to apply: *Feed Forward Neural Network* and *Decision Tree*. To do so the user needs to change the `model_name` variable, in line number 434, to either `NN` or `DT`, respectively.
2. For training from scratch the models (with the Genetic Algorithm output), only delete either the `neuralgen.h5` or `decision_tree_model_joblib.pickle` files.
3. As we provide, the program runs only on one instance, but uncomment from the lines 464 up to 518, and comment from the lines 436 up to 462, to run with all the instances available (i.e., 360).
4. The results are exported in the `results.csv` file, and the output generated by our Genetic Algorithm (i.e., the conditions and actions to train our AI models), are in folder named `output`.
